*A modular scientific software toolkit.
It provides all the functionalities needed to deal with big data processing,
statistical analysis, visualisation and storage.
It is mainly written in C++ but integrated with other languages such as Python and R.*

It is the primary toolkit for many experimental analysis and while you are
free to analyze these datasets however you like, some familiarity with
ROOT will serve you well when accessing the data.

* Many ROOT examples can be found [here](https://root.cern/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html>).
If you don't know where to start, we would recommend
    * Example 1
    * Example 2
    * Example 3


* Python has become the language of choice for many analysts and most of the examples
  you'll see make use of the PyROOT module, callable from python. You can go through
  a number of the examples [here](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__tutorial__pyroot.html).
